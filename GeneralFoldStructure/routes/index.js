//This is where all the general routes sit (i.e. landing page)
//We refactor the routes into individual files once they become RESTful

//General structure

//var express = require("express");
//var router = express.Router(); - this allow us to module and export our routes easily

//Required Files
//Passport, Models, etc.

//router.get("/", function(req,res){
    //res.render("landing")
//});

//module.exports = router;
