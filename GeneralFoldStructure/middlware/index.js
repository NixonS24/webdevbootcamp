//This is where all the general middleware sits
//We can refactor out the middlware into individual files if you want 
//i.e. campground.js & comment.js but as there is only one probably not worth it
//General structure

//var middlewareObjects = {}

//middlewareObject.$ObjectName = function() {
    
//}

//module.exports = middlewareObject
//Then required in your app.js (or other route file)
